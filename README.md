# RL on Games
My repository for RL experiments on games, primarily with the OpenAI gym environment.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Currently just has basic deep RL algorithm implementations on Mario. Will later include Pokemon Showdown bots...
